Internally, a computer knows no characters whatsoever: every piece of information is represented as numbers (which in turn are represented in a binary format, as zeroes and ones). An encoding specifies which numbers represent which characters. A famous and long-standing encoding scheme is ASCII, in which for example the letter 'A' is encoded using the number 65. ASCII however only has a very limited alphabet and can not encode a lot of writing systems. A modern-day encoding supporting countless writing systems is *unicode* and *utf-8* is a kind of unicode. This the type of encoding that you will want to use for your data whenever possible. Whenever you have a choice, you should use unicode!"

    "Now check out the files in your Desktop folder: you will notice that an additional file has been created, namely `script.pyc`. (If you can't see file, note that you can explicitly list all files in the current directory using the `ls` command in both Windows and Unix-like operating systems.) The extension of this new file stands for 'Compiled Python File'. Don't worry about this file -- you won't be able to inspect its contents using a text editor anyway. This file contains the numerical 'bytecode' that will be executed by your machine: it is this machine-readable version of your code that has actually been imported into the `main.py` module. You can safely ignore these files, but now you know what they are for. (By the way: note that there is no `main.pyc` file which has been created, because no functionality from this file has been imported into another module.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always a good idea to distribute your code over a set of modules. In technical terms, your code should be as 'modular' as possible, meaning that similar functions should be grouped into the same module. This will help you keep your code organized especially when you are working on a larger project. If you have a set of functions that use you for loading and parsing files in Python, why not group under the same module? This way you can organize your own coding more efficiently, as well as share and document your code more easily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how how to store and organize your code in separate files and modules. Still, a lot of programmers continue to explore their data using 'interactive Python' via a so-called 'interactive Python interpreter' that more or less resembles the IPython envirionment you have been working in so far. To launch such an interpreter, just type in `python3` in your console and hit enter. This will launch a `live` Python session in your command line console where you can experiment with your data by typing in commands, much like you have done in the IPython environment so far. Try this out! Just type in lines of Python code after the `>>>` prompt and hit enter to execute it immediately."

    "> - Periods internal to a sequence of letters with no adjacent whitespace are not sentence boundaries, such as in www.aptex.com or e.g.\n",

Your task here is to write a function that given the name of a text file is able to write its content with each sentence on a separate line to a new file whose name is also passed as an argument to the function. The function itself should return a list of sentences. Test your program with the following short text: \"Mr. Smith bought cheapsite.com for 1.5 million dollars, i.e. he paid a lot for it.
